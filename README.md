# Overview
This dapps allows you to mint NFT, thus allowing you to test the Linea Network within the test network, thus leaving a record in the blockchain. Linea Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps). By leveraging Layer 2 technology, Linea Network can offer lower gas fees and increased transaction throughput compared to the Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1).

Linea Network utilizes optimistic rollups, a popular Layer 2 scaling solution. Optimistic rollups bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction that is then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet. By doing so, it reduces the load on the Ethereum network, resulting in lower transaction costs and faster processing times.

Linea Network can be particularly beneficial for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other use cases that require high transaction throughput and low fees. It can help make Ethereum more accessible and usable, addressing some of the scalability issues that have hindered broader adoption.
